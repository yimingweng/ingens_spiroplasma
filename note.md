1. According to [Weng et al.,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33938156/) the endosymbiotic *Spiroplasma* is present in the *Nebria ingens* complex, the alpine ground beetle species endemic to the Sierra Nevada of California.
2. For each of the 384 specimens of *N. ingens* complex, we have low-coverage whole genome sequence data available. 
3. The project is to detect and analyze the genomic data of the *Spiroplasma* from the *Nebria ingens* complex.
4. The work was done in [Schoville's Lab](https://molecularecology.russell.wisc.edu/) and the participants are Sean Schoville, Yi-Ming Weng, and Robert Hall.
5. The first step is to scan through the genomes of the beetle samples.
6. The working directory is in the Fuji computer under the path: `/media/Jade/YMW/spiroplasma/spiroscan`. In this repository, it is the scanning folder.
